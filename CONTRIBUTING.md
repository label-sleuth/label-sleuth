### Contributor License Agreement

Before contributing to the project, all contributors must sign a Contributor License Agreement (CLA). By signing the CLA, you are attesting that you are the author of the contribution and you are freely contributing it under the terms of the Apache-2.0 license.

To this end, when submitting a Pull Request, please include a copy of the [Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1](https://elinux.org/Developer_Certificate_Of_Origin) along with your Pull Request.

### Working on Issues

While not required, it is good practice to ensure before you start working on a code change that what you will be working on is captured in an issue. This allows the community to be aware of what everyone is working on and provide input before you spend time on the actual change.

### Pull Requests

We use [GitHub pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) to accept contributions. Once submitted, the pull request will be reviewed by the community as explained below.

### Code Review

Code review of pull requests is open to anyone. While only maintainers can merge pull requests, community feedback on pull requests is very valuable. It can also be helpful in becoming acquainted with the codebase. You can find a list of open pull requests [here](https://github.com/label-sleuth/label-sleuth/pulls).   

### Asking for Help/Feedback

If you are working on the code and need help finishing it or would want to get input from the community on the approach that you are following, you can create a Work In Progress pull request. To this end, prefix the title of your pull request with the "[WIP]" string. This will inform the reviewer that the code is not final. It also means that the pull request will not be merged. When the pull request is ready to be reviewed for merging, the reviewer or you can remove the "[WIP]" prefix.
