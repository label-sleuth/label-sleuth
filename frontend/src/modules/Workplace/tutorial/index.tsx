          Label Sleuth is a no-code system for quickly creating custom text
          classifiers; no technical expertise required! Label Sleuth guides you
          through the data annotation process, while automatically creating an
          AI model in the background. This process is iterative, with the system
          automatically improving the model as you annotate more examples. The
          goal is to get a high-performance text classification model for your
          use case after just a few hours of interacting with Label Sleuth.

          <p>
            Start by creating a category describing the aspect of the dataset
            that you want to identify. Make sure that the category is
            well-defined (i.e., it is clear to you whether a given text belongs
            to the category or not). In the binary mode, you will be working one
            category at a time; a design decision that has been made to make the
            data annotation and model building process more efficient. However,
            you may create several categories within a workspace and switch
            between them as needed.

          <p>
            Once you have created a category, you can start annotating the data.
            Annotation is a process that helps the AI model understand how to
            identify your category. The annotation system is binary - positive
            or negative - meaning that the text either matches the category
            definition or not.
          </p>
          <p>
            Annotate elements as positive or negative examples by clicking on
            the corresponding icons shown below. Note that annotations are not
            final; if you made a mistake, you can go back and edit your
            annotations as many times as you like.

            {" "}
            In the common case, where positive examples in your data are rare
            (i.e., less than 20% of the text elements are positives), spend more
            time on finding and annotating positive examples, as they are more
            valuable for the AI model to identify your category.

            You can try to find good examples to annotate by skimming through
            your documents. However, a faster way to find positive examples is
            to search for terms that they contain. While looking at the search
            results, clicking on a text element will bring up the element in the
            document view, allowing you to inspect its surrounding text. You can
            annotate text elements either in the search results or in the
            document view.
