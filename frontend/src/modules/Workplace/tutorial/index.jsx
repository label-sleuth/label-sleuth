        is a no-code system for quickly creating custom text classifiers; no technical expertise required!
        Label Sleuth guides you through the data annotation process, while automatically creating an AI model
        in the background. This process is iterative, with the system automatically improving the model
        as you annotate more examples. The goal is to get a high-performance text classification model
        for your use case after just a few hours of interacting with Label Sleuth.

          <p>
          Start by creating a category describing the aspect of the dataset that you want to identify.
          Make sure that the category is well-defined (i.e., it is clear to you whether a given text belongs
          to the category or not). In Label Sleuth you will be working one category at a time; a design decision
          that has been made to make the data annotation and model building process more efficient.
          However, you may create several categories within a workspace and switch between them as needed.

      content: (
        <div>
          <p>
            Once you have created a category, you can start annotating the data. Annotation is a process that
            helps the AI model understand how to identify your category.
            The annotation system is binary - positive or negative - meaning that the text either matches the category definition or not.
            Annotate elements as positive or negative examples by clicking on the corresponding icons shown below.
            Note that annotations are not final; if you made a mistake, you can go back and edit your annotations as many times as you like.
            In the common case, where positive examples in your data are rare (i.e., less than 20% of the text elements are positives), spend more 
            time on finding and annotating positive examples, as they are more valuable for the AI model to identify your category.

            You can try to find good examples to annotate by skimming through your documents. 
            However, a faster way to find positive examples is to search for terms that they contain.
            While looking at the search results, double-clicking on a text element will bring up the element in
            the document view, allowing you to inspect its surrounding text. You can annotate text elements
            either in the search results or in the document view.

            Initially, there is no AI model yet. 
            Keep annotating until Label Sleuth prepares a first version of the model for you. 
            The progress bar on the left shows how many annotations are missing until Label Sleuth starts training a model. 
            Whenever a new version of the model is available, a confetti animation will notify you of the new model.

            The model makes predictions on your entire dataset. Examples it predicts to be positive (i.e., belonging to the category of interest) 
            are shown with a dotted blue outline. Try to annotate some of these positive predictions to provide feedback to the model 
            on where it is correct and where it is wrong.
